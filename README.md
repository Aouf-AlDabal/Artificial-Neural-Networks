# Artificial-Neural-Networks2D
As we see the program has four parts: Importing of libraries, training datasets, construct the model, and start training the model. First full, I imported the libraries, which are future, TensorFlow, Keras. After that, I defined the training dataset, which is containing two parts: X is the features that define the input object, and Y is the label of that object. In this dataset, I have six objects. Then, I started to construct the model. It has five layers. The number 80 indicates the number of hidden units in the layer. The activation function that I used it was relu function. And the last layer is the output layer. Finally, I trained the model on my dataset, which I defined previously. I put 6 in epochs that is means the number of iterations will be 6 to allow the model to improve its weights.
