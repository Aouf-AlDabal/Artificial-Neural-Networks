# Artificial-Neural-Networks
As we see the programe has four parts: Importing of libraries, training dataset, construct the model, and start training the model. First full, I imported the libraries, which are future, tensorflow, Keras. After that, I defined the training dataset, which is containing two parts: X is the features that define the input object, and Y is the label of that object. In this dataset, I have six objects. Then, I started to construct the model. It has five layers. The number 80 indicates number hidden units in the layer. The activation function that I used it was relu function. And the last layer is output layer. Finally, I trained the model on the my dataset, which I defined it previously. I put 6 in epochs that is mean the number of itrations will be 6 to allow the model to improve its weights.
